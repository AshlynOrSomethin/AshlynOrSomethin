## Age/Gender/Interests
	- I am 20 as of writing this (12/18/2023), my birthday is in March.
	- I am female, pronouns are she/they. Although, I couldn't really care less here.
	- I love music, can play over 20 instruments. I write poetry, code, and play games with friends often.
	- I'm interested in politics but keep them out of the FOSS community, we don't need that stuff here. 
	- Anything else on these kinds of subjects are an ask to know basis.

## Projects
	- I am working on an Arch based Linux distribution for close friends, don't intend on releasing it fully (ever). The tools used are forked on my profile here on GitHub, mainly just a customized applications set by default on top of KDE Plasma.
